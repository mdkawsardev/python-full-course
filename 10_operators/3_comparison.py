# Comparison Operators
#? Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

"""
? ==            equal                    x == y
? !=            not equal                x != y
? >             greater than             x > y
? <             less than                x < y
? >=            greater than or equal    x >= y
? <=            less than or equal       x <= y

"""
#* Comparison operators return True or False based on the comparison:

x = 5
y = 6
print(x == y)
print(x != y)
print(x > y)
print(x < y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)
