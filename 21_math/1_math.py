# Python Math
#* Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.
#* Built-in Math Functions
#* The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:
x = min(2, 4, 6, 1, 9)
y = max(2, 8, 4, 5, 9)
print(x)
print(y)

#? The abs() function returns the absolute (positive) value of the specified number:
ab = abs(-4.09)
print(ab)

#? The pow(x, y) function returns the value of x to the power of y (xy).
#* Return the value of 4 to the power of 3 (same as 4 * 4 * 4):
po = pow(4, 3)
print(po)
