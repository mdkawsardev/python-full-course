#? The Math Module
#* Python has also a built-in module called 'math', which extends the list of mathematical functions.
#* To use it, you must import the 'math' module:
import math
#* When you have imported the 'math' module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.
#* The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:
x = math.sqrt(64)
print(x)

#? The 'math.ceil()' method rounds a number upwards to its nearest integer, and the 'math.floor()' method rounds a number downwards to its nearest integer, and returns the result:
y = math.ceil(2.5) #* Round a number upward to its nearest integer
z = math.floor(2.5) #* Round a number downward to its nearest integer
print(y)
print(z)
