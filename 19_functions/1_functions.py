# Functions in Python
"""
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

A function can return data as a result.

A function helps avoiding code repetition.
"""

#? Creating a Function
#* In Python, a function is defined using the 'def' keyword, followed by a function name and parentheses:
def my_func():
    print("Hello World")
#* This creates a function named my_func that prints "Hello World" when called.
#* The code inside the function must be indented. Python uses indentation to define code blocks.

#? Calling a Function
#* To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses:
def my_func():
    print("Hello World")
my_func()
#* You can call the same function multiple times:
my_func()
my_func()
my_func()

"""
#? Function Names
#* Function names follow the same rules as variable names in Python:
A function name must start with a letter or underscore
A function name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
Function names are case-sensitive (myFunction and myfunction are different)
"""
"""
#? Valid function names:
calculate_sum()
_private_function()
myFunction2()
? It's good practice to use descriptive names that explain what the function does.
"""

#? Why Use Functions?
#* Imagine you need to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius several times in your program. Without functions, you would have to write the same calculation code repeatedly:
#* Without functions - repetitive code:
temp1 = 77
celsius1 = (temp1 - 32) * 5 / 9
print(celsius1)

temp2 = 95
celsius2 = (temp2 - 32) * 5 / 9
print(celsius2)

temp3 = 50
celsius3 = (temp3 - 32) * 5 / 9
print(celsius3)

#* With functions, you write the code once and reuse it:
#* With functions - reusable code:
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
  return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(77))
print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(95))
print(fahrenheit_to_celsius(50))

#? Return Values
#* Functions can send data back to the code that called them using the return statement.
#* When a function reaches a return statement, it stops executing and sends the result back:
#* A function that returns a value:
def greeting():
    return "Good Morning"
message = greeting()
print(message)
#* You can use the returned value directly:
#* Using the return value directly:
def greeting():
    return "Good Morning"
print(greeting())
#! If a function doesn't have a return statement, it returns None by default.

#? The pass Statement
#* Function definitions cannot be empty. If you need to create a function placeholder without any code, use the pass statement:
def passing():
    pass
#* The pass statement is often used when developing, allowing you to define the structure first and implement details later.
